# Unit 15 - Website Development - Assignment 2 - Viktor Salihu

## P2 Produce designs for a website that meet client requirements. 

### The client's recuirements: 
1. Profile of the company itself.
2. Profiles of existing trainee web developers.
3. Job specifications and required qualifications.
4. An online application form.
5. Links to web development courses.


### Visual designs for the website
I have used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create some visual designs. I have used it because it has easy navigation and it is user friendly. It will provide me with a good overview of the website and it will help me to create a good design.

This is the first design I have made:

### Alternative design options

I was asked to create two designs, one main and one alternative. This is the alternative design I have created: 
![](Img\Design\Alternative.png)

I was not provided with a logo so I have created one. Now I can use the logo to create a favicon and also use it in the website to show proffesionality and to make the website more appealing.

This is the logo I have created:

### Technical documentation
For the technical documentation, I will include information such as, fonts, sizes of the fonts, colors, images, and other information that will help me to create the website.

## P3 Review the website design proposals with others to identify and inform improvements.

### Feedback

| Full name | Feedback |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Saul  | The Alternative design follows a confusing layout, with long columns that contain naivgation (probably better-off at the top of the page where it is more useful). The main design remedies this with a navigation bar at the top of the page which sticks to the top as you scroll. The layout is more intuitive with white space left and right of the main content which is displayed in seperate rows. Overall, the main design considers the requirements of a user in navigation and layout where the alternative design fails. |
| Armandas  | The Alternative design falls short in terms of user experience due to its confusing layout. The long columns housing the navigation elements make it difficult to navigate and find important information. In contrast, the main design showcases a superior approach by featuring a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page, allowing for effortless navigation as users scroll through the content. The main design's intuitive layout, with separate rows and ample white space on the sides, enhances readability and clarity. It considers the requirements of users in terms of navigation and layout, making it more user-friendly and efficient. Overall, while the alternative design struggles with its confusing structure, the main design excels in providing a seamless and user-oriented experience. |

### Feedback evaluation

I have received feedback from two of my peers. They both agree that the alternative design is confusing and hard to navigate. They both agree that the main design is better and more user friendly. 


## P4 Produce a website for an intended audience and purpose. 

### The website

#### **Development process**
Before doing anything, I have installed all the software I need to develop the webiste so it can have appealing look. 
I have downloaded Visual Studio code and PhotoShop for editing any images. 

I have created the folder structure for the website (Img, Web, Docs) so it can be easy accessible and navigatable by any other people that will work on the website.

I have used HTML, CSS, JS to create the website. I have used HTML to create the structure of the website, CSS to style the website and JS to make the website interactive.

In this way I have followed the best practice of clean, readible and maintainable code.

#### **Structure and Navigation**

+ Structure - The structure of the website will be 1 page. The user will have all the needed information in one page where it can be scrolled all the way down.

+ Navigation - The navigation will be easy to use, I have included a navigation bar at the top (ABOUT US, PART OF THE TEAM, TESTIMONIALS, OPENED POSITIONS, APPLICATION FORM, CONTACT US). 

     Each of the navigation bar will be highlighted when the user is on that section of the website. This will imporve the navigation and will prevent the user from getting lost in the website.

    I have also included a back to top button so the user can easily go back to the top of the page. This will improve the user experience and will make the website more user friendly.

### Content creation

#### **Pictures** 
I have used [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) to download the images I need for the website. I have used this website because it provides free images and it is easy to use.

#### **Text**
I have typed the text myself while using [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check for any spelling mistakes and to make sure the text is easy to read and understand.

#### **Video**
I have used [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) to download the video I need for the website. I have used this website because it provides free videos and it is easy to use.

#### **Application Form**
I have created an application form which is functional and it can be sent to the email that the developer wants to go

![](other\applicationform.PNG)



#### **Profile of existing employees**
One of the organisation's requirements was profiles of existing trainee web developers. I have cerated a section which shows 3 existing employees, with a short message from them. 
![](other\existingemployee.PNG)

#### **Link for courses**
Another requirement was to add links to development courses. I have added a section which shows 3 links to courses.

### **Responsive Design**
The design I have created is indeed responsive. It is easy to be used by computer, tablet and mobile(Any oriantation).

## M3 Optimise a website to meet client requirements.

### Optimisation feedback:

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 17/05/2023 | Armandas | I think on the about us section, the design for the slideshow is not interesting and appealing, try adding another design. |
| 17/05/2023 | Saul | The job listing is not appealing, try adding another design. |

### Implement optimizations

I have implemented only one of the two feedback suggestions. I have changed the design of the about us section, because I agreed that the design of the slider did not look apealing. I have not made big difference on the design, just a small touch up.
